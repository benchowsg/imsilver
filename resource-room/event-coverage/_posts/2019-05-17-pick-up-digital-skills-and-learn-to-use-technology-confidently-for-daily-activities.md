Are you finding it difficult to pick up digital skills from your children? Fret not, you are not alone. The Silver Infocomm Fiesta is a specially designed collection of classes that equip seniors with digital skills for daily activities such as e-Payment, accessing government services and more. You can also sign up for classes on e-Travel, e-Entertainment and Navigating Around Singapore to meet your daily living needs. These IT Classes are held at various Silver Infocomm Junctions (SIJ) island-wide.

Here are some of the popular classes you can sign up for:

**Basic Digital Skills**

You will be able to learn Basic Digital Skills covering four key areas:

1. Managing Information & Communications
2. Transacting Digitally
3. Accessing Government Services
4. Staying Safe Online

You will also pick up useful cyber security tips such as how to spot fake news, how to go safe online, to protect yourself in today’s digital world.

**Government Digital Services**

With many government agencies such as People’s Association (PA), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Municipal Services Office (MSO), providing digital services to make transactions more convenient for citizens, it is important for everyone to be able to benefit from such services. For example, you can sign up for activities or book facilities in the community club via OnePA.sg website, or check for bus timings via My Transport.sg app.

You can learn how to gain access to government digital services by signing up for the SingPass course with selected Silver Infocomm Junctions. You will also learn the importance of protecting your SingPass account, as well as pick up cybersecurity tips to protect your account.

Mr. Nathan S Pathmanathan S/O Sinniah participated in the Social Networking workshop (Facebook). While he had a Facebook account prior to attending the class, he did not know how to use it. After attending the class, Mr. Pathmanathan was more confident in using Facebook. He felt that the class environment was conducive to pick up new digital skills as there were hands-on practice opportunities and helpful volunteers to provide assistance whenever you need it.

 Mr. Sam Des always had an interest in learning about e-payment and cybersecurity but found it difficult to keep-up when he was learning from his children. After attending the two-day Basic Digital Skills class, he became more confident in starting his learning journey. Besides the helpful volunteers present during the class, Mr. Des felt that the courseware allowed him to learn at a pace comfortable for him.
