## Myths About Learning Digital Skills<br>

Some people, especially seniors, may feel that learning basic digital skills is a stumbling block. However, what may seem like a challenge could also turn chores into a breeze with a simple click of a button. We take a look at some of the common myths about learning digital skills that may discourage some against dipping their toes into the digital waters. 

**1.	The Long and Winding Road**

Introducing Tony and Ricky, two seniors who are on the opposite end of the digital skills spectrum – Ricky loves exploring new ways of doing things, while Tony is less confident about picking a new skill at his age, and prefers doing things the conventional way. In this video, Tony is finally convinced by his wife and his friends to attend an infocomm learning class to pick up basic digital skills. He is apprehensive about it at first. But after attending, he is surprised that he enjoyed the class and found the content useful and meaningful. He is even excited to put his skills to use immediately and attempt to book a ride home using his mobile phone.

When someone hears phrases like “digital skills”, big books and time-consuming courses may cross one’s mind. In fact, it is not as complicated as it seems. There are many options available to help people, especially seniors, to adopt digital skills. For instance, IMDA has a one-day Basic Digital Skills course that helps prepares people to be digitally ready! Through the one-day training, seniors can learn common everyday skills such as surfing the internet to search for information, chatting with friends virtually through text messages and accessing digital services such as internet banking, online shopping and transport booking. 

**2.	The Traditional Way is the Best Way**

The friends are back together again! The group is singing along happily to songs from a selection of DVDs when a problem arises: they can’t find the next song. The digitally-savvy Ricky suggests using his phone to search for the missing song title to play on the smart TV, but Tony stops him and insists on checking through his storeroom to look for the original DVD which contains the song. While he frantically searches the house, the party goes on in the living room as Ricky looks up the song using his phone.

Some seniors may still rely on the tried-and-tested way of doing things. For instance, some may prefer using a DVD player over online video sites such as YouTube or Netflix. In fact, we could make our daily life more convenient with digital technology. It allows us to access information with just a click of a button. In this instance, digital technology has allowed Ricky to tap on online video services to search for the missing song title effortlessly. He saved time and space as he no longer needs a storage space to store his physical items. 


**3.	What’s the Point? It’s Too Troublesome!**

It’s a dinner party, the guests are arriving, but there’s a key ingredient missing for the main dish! The gauntlet is thrown down when Ricky decides to order groceries on his phone while Tony insists that going out to the shops will be faster. It’s a race against time when Tony scrambles to find the correct shop as they are closing, and Ricky orders the ingredients on a mobile application.

Some may feel that it is not worth the trouble to learn basic digital skills. After all, one could simply hail a taxi by the roadside while lugging heavy groceries home from the supermarket, tedious tasks that usually go hand-in-hand. However, with just a few taps on a mobile device, users can peruse online shopping services and have groceries delivered to your doorstep. Transportation is also readily available online. Let the taxi come to you instead of you searching for one manually!
