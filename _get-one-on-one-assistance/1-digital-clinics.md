<br>The Digital Clinic provides a one-on-one concierge-type assistance. This is a volunteer-led initiative and is available to anyone who is looking for help on how to use their mobile devices, such as smartphones. 

Digital Clinic sessions cater to both iOS and Android device users. These sessions are open to all ages and are held in public libraries and community spaces regularly. Participants can walk-in and be attended to on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Participants at the Digital Clinic will learn how to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, personalise accessibility tools (e.g. text size, magnifier, voice-to-text, hearing function) and learn applications on their mobile devices. The Digital Clinic volunteers will also share information on relevant mobile lifestyle applications and tips on online discernment suitable for daily use with the participants.<br>

Alternatively, participants can also enjoy the convenience of e-Payments by visiting an e-Payment Digital Clinic to get tips on how to use e-payment in their everyday lives.
