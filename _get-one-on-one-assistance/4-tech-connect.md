Tech Connect is an initiative that provides dedicated one-on-one tech assistance to any person who may need help with their digital devices and services.<br>

How does “Tech Connect” work? You simply walk in to any of the eight CCs that are part of this pilot project and look for PA staff, known as your “Tech Connect Kakis”. These “Tech Connect Kakis” will then provide you with one-on-one assistance.<br>
