For many of us, ordering food, buying groceries or booking a ride online are common things we do everyday and often taken for granted. Yet there are some segments of our community who require some assistance, to be able to fully experience the same benefits brought about by technology.

As part of Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)’s Digital Readiness efforts to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era, the inaugural Digital Inclusion Festival (DI Fest) was organised to bring everyone together to embrace technology. DI Fest pays special attention to community segments such as the low-income families, people with disabilities (PWDs) and senior citizens.

##### Singapore’s Biggest Digital Inclusion Carnival Yet!

The Lifelong Learning Institute was transformed into a three-day mega digital carnival from 26-28 July, with over thirteen thousand visitors keeping the place buzzing with non-stop excitement. From key activities like tech exhibits, hourly tutorials, hands-on workshops, to the more light-hearted music performances and interactive games, visitors were truly spoilt for choices. More than 450 volunteers from IMDA’s SG:D Friends programme also came forward to help out at the event. At the DI Fest, visitors got to experience a digital future, and learn the importance to be digitally ready.

“It is key that we do not leave anyone behind in this digital transition,” said Mr. S Iswaran, Minister for Communication and Information, at the opening speech “It falls upon all of us as a community to make sure that every Singaporean is able to enjoy the benefits brought about by technology, and to help everyone to be digitally-ready, especially our seniors and persons with disabilities.”

**Enable IT Forum and Workshops**

Infocomm and Assistive Technology (IT/AT) can transform the lives of persons with disabilities (PWDs). PWDs and caregivers echoed this sentiment at the forum.

Associate Professor Wong Meng Ee from the Nanyang Technological University shared his experience as a PWD who actively uses assistive technology. He advocated incorporating technology into the process of learning to help PWDs access a world of possibilities.

Ms Manju Mohta, who works with special needs children at Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore, was also heartened by her experience at DI Fest. “I’m really touched by the inclusion efforts here. In our class, we had 3 PWDs, 2 senior citizens, a few professionals and children. There was no segregation and we were all learning together.”

Singapore’s first ever DI Fest would not be complete without IMDA’s signature Digital Clinic. Held in more than 60 locations island-wide since Nov 2017, these clinics have helped over six thousand seniors with their smartphone-related queries. With help from friendly volunteers who patiently guided one attendee at a time, our seniors can confidently flaunt their new digital skills to their children and grandchildren!


##### Hello Digital World!    

People from all walks of life turned up at this event and were excited to enjoy the festivities. But there was no greater excitement than that felt by newcomers to the digital experience.

81-year-old Mr Abdul Gafoor was one of the inquisitive first-time visitors at this digital inclusion event. Discovering the festival through newspapers, he came for the MyCPF tutorial armed with questions. Seated near the front of stage, he was assisted by a friendly volunteer. “I learnt so many things today, like how to use my handphone to access government services. Next time, I can use my handphone to get information. I need not spend time travelling and queueing.” 

##### Tender Hearts, Helping Hands    

This massive event would not be possible without the invaluable support from the SG:D Friends, a collective of volunteers from various government agencies and corporations across Singapore.
