We all assume that technology exists to offer convenience in our lives.

But for some segments in our society, such as senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs), technology could literally transform their lives. 

There are mobile apps that make it simple for anyone with a smartphone to make e-payments, book a taxi or use Digital Government services. Or even to watch K-dramas on the MRT!

For the disabled, there are Infocomm and Assistive Technologies (IT/AT) that enable and empower them, as such voice-activated accessibility tools. There are IT/AT tools to empower people with different kinds of physical disabilities to lead normal, enriching lives at home, at work and at play.

While new technologies can appear intimidating at first, it only takes a little learning and some tender coaching to get started!

No one should be left behind, in other words, in the Digital Economy era.

The inaugural Digital Inclusion Festival (DI Fest) will showcase the possibilities of digital technologies that can help everyone in the community.

The three-day community carnival will be held from 26-28 July at the Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI). 

The Festival is organised as part of IMDA’s Digital Readiness efforts.

<h4>Key highlights</h4>

To ensure that no one is left behind by digitalisation, DI Fest aims to encourage everyone to embrace technology and be digitally ready to enjoy the benefits afforded by technology. 

These are some of the highlight events that you definitely don’t want to miss!

**Cyber Health Hour**

We interact with the Internet on a daily basis in one way or another -- reading an email, browsing an article, playing a game or shopping online. 

Thus, it is important to know how to keep safe from online threats that aim to, among other things, disable your device or steal your personal data.

At the Cyber Health Hour, you can pick up important tips on cybersecurity and understand how to navigate virtual platforms safely. 

Held at the main stage at 2pm to 3pm daily, the Cyber Health Hour lets you pick up the key knowledge to enjoy your cyber experience without falling prey to online dangers. 

What’s more, you might even be accompanied by celebrities during your learning journey! Yes, you can get up close with Mediacorp DJs from YES 93.3, LOVE 97.2 as well as Getai celebrities Hao Hao and Lee Hui Fen!

**Digital Clinics**

The smart phone is a powerful device, akin to a supercomputer in our hands! But not everyone understands how to use the key features and functions. 

That’s why those who need help can turn to IMDA’s Digital Clinics, where friendly volunteers provide one-on-one coaching to answer all your smartphone-related queries. 

Whether it is setting up the Wi-Fi connection or taking better pictures using the camera settings, you can be sure the Digital Clinic volunteers will help you to get it right!

**Touch and Play Zone**

Calling all soccer fans! 

Our Touch and Play Zone features an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience of Anfield Stadium, the legendary home of recently crowned European champions, Liverpool Football Club. 

You can also create your own customised souvenirs using a 3D pen, attempt an exhilarating plank walk experience between skyscrapers or colour a whole new world through a VR tilt brush experience.

You’re virtually guaranteed to have tons of fun at the Touch and Play Zone, no matter whether you are young – or young-at-heart!

**Engineering Good**

Play is critical in development and education, not to mention, an essential part of growing up!

At the Hack-a-toy workshop conducted by Engineering Good, you can help support children with special needs by building toys for them. 

At the session, participants will create effective switches that can be paired with commercially accessible toys, making them better suited for the children to play with.

Switches created at the festival will be donated to the children, so we hope you can do your part to help them!

#### Old is gold - Appreciation for Seniors

As Singapore grows into a digital society, it is important to recognise and appreciate the Merdeka Generation, whose contributions – together with the Pioneer Generation’s efforts -- have helped to build our nation into the success story that it is today.

Which is why DI Fest is holding a Smart Breakfast specially for both the Merdeka Generation and Pioneer Generation exclusively. 

During this event, the seniors will be able to enjoy a sumptuous breakfast spread while learning about the latest digital applications that can help them stay active and connected.

#### Enabling Technologies

Embracing technology is vital for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and their caregivers, as it enables them to lead fulfilling lives.

The DI Fest will be an exciting showcase for enabling technologies.

As Singapore continues to build a more inclusive society, marrying cutting-edge technology with good design is a necessary step in helping people with special needs. 

Hence, visit the Accessibility zone of the Exhibition to explore what digital tools can do for persons-with-disabilities (PWDs) and others who require assistance in our society today. 

The DI Fest will also host the Enable IT Forum, where PWDs, caregivers and industry experts will share transformational stories on how adopting Infocomm and Assistive Technologies (IT/AT) have enabled and empowered them to lead more fulfilling lives.
