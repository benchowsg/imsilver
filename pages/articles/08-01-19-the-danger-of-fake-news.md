Below are some tips from Media Literacy Council ([Source](https://www.betterinternet.sg/Resources/Resources-Listing/Seniors---fake-news){:target="_blank"}) to help you identify fake news:

- **Check the source:** try find your news from credible sources that have a good reputation, not just through your friends or social media.
- **Look at the ‘About us’ or ‘Contact us’ pages:** websites with the intent to mislead often don’t have these pages, or have very little helpful information on them.
- **Be sceptical of dramatic headlines:** headlines that are particularly dramatic are probably exaggerating something, so be sure to double check these.
- **Look up the language:** if an article has lots of spelling or grammatical errors, it likely has not been rigorously checked by the news source.
- **Confirm with other reliable sources:** check other news sites to see if the same story is running on multiple credible sources.
- **Go to the experts:** websites such as [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Factually](https://www.gov.sg/factually){:target="_blank"}, and [FactCheck](https://www.factcheck.org/){:target="_blank"} have teams who verify whether popular news stories are true or fake.
