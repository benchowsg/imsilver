Whenever we hear or read about people being victims of scams, our first reaction is usually ‘that won’t happen to me!’.  However, scams are becoming more widespread and sophisticated nowadays. In Singapore, a shocking S$99 million was lost to scams in 2017 alone according to the Police [(Source)](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-99-million-lost-to-scams-in-2017-police-9945700){:target="_blank"}.

What happened to the victims you read or hear about in the media could also happen to your colleagues, friends, family members and even you!

So how can we protect ourselves from scams? We can start by being aware of the types of scams out there.


**Phishing Scam**<br>

Phishing Scam
What is a phishing scam?  It happens when a scammer tries to lure you into providing sensitive information such as your personal and financial information and passwords by pretending to be from a legitimate source.

Phishing can be done by phone calls, emails, SMS, social media and fake websites. Some examples of common phishing scams include:

1. Fake emails that instruct you to click on a link to rectify a discrepancy with your account by providing your personal information.

2. Fake websites that look similar to the official websites but with the wrong web address. The website will trick you into giving scammers your personal details.

3. Email with use of urgent or threatening language. Cyber criminals hope to instil panic and fear to trick you into acceding to their requests for information. Be wary of emails with phrases such as ‘urgent action required’ or ‘your account will be terminated’.

4. WhatsApp message from someone pretending to be from a legitimate organisation, asking you for your personal information to claim a prize or special offer.

5. Email with your name, position, company, work phone number and other information, making you believe that the email is legitimate.
