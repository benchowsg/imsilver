#### Digital Readiness

Building Digital Readiness in Singaporeans is part of Singaporeâ€™s digitalisation efforts to ensure that every Singaporean is digitally ready to seize the benefits and opportunities afforded by technology. Various programmes have been rolled out to build a digital society where no one is left behind in the push towards a digital future; where our people have the necessary tools and skills to thrive; and can use technology to participate meaningfully in the Digital Economy. 
Our programmes aim to provide people with affordable digital access, digital literacy skills and know-how to use digital technology safely and confidently, as well as inspire adoption of new emerging technologies through experiential learnings.

#### Silver Infocomm Initiative

The Silver Infocomm Initiative (SII) is a Digital Inclusion effort, led by the government in strong partnership with industry, academia and the community, to engage seniors and mature adults so that they, too will be able to benefit from a digital economy. This is made more evident as Singapore progresses into the digital economy, with many critical government services moving online. 

The success of SII hinges on the following:<br> 
* a multi-pronged approach
* strong partnership
* active volunteerism and 
* continuous government support. 

These elements are demonstrated through the various strategies implemented under the SII branding.
