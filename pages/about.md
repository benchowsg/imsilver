#### What is IM Silver?

![about](/images/about/about.jpg)

IM Silver is an initiative by IMDA to help vulnerable groups of Singaporeans to achieve Digital Readiness, so as not to be left behind as society continues to digitise. With our many programmes tailored for individuals of every level of digital competency, we reach out to the community to lend a helping hand to those who need it and ensure they can participate meaningfully in a digital society. 

#### Digital Readiness

Digital technologies can make our daily lives for convenient and sustainable, but they can also enable us to strengthen our community and society. It is therefore important that we help all Singaporeans leverage the opportunities provided by digital technology, so we can all fully reap the benefits together in a truly Smart Nation.
