#### IM Silver

IM Silver Portal, at <div style="display: inline">www.IMSilver.sg</div> is a website launched by IMDA aimed at helping seniors and matured adults to learn how to go digital.  It provides online guides, content and resources where seniors can learn how to use mobile and digital technologies. 

#### Digital Readiness

Digital technologies can make our daily lives more convenient and they can also impacting the way we work, live, learn and play. It is therefore important that all Singaporeans leverage the opportunities provided by digital technology, so we can all fully reap the benefits together in a truly Smart Nation.  

We reach out to the community to lend a helping hand to those who need it and help ensure all can participate meaningfully in a digital society. 

Our programmes aim to provide access to technology, digital literacy skills and know-how, as well as inspiring adoption of new technologies through experiential learnings.  

#### Silver Infocomm Initiative

The Silver Infocomm Initiative (SII) is a Digital Inclusion effort, led by the government in strong partnership with industry, academia and the community, to engage the seniors so that they, too will be able to benefit from a digital economy. This is made more evident as Singapore develops to be a Smart Nation, with many critical government services moving online. 

The success of SII hinges on the following:<br> 
* a multi-pronged approach
* strong partnership
* active volunteerism and 
* sustained government support. 

These elements are demonstrated through the various strategies implemented under the SII branding.
