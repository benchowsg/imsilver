Friends of Silver Infocomm (FSI) is a programme launched in August 2016, under the Silver Infocomm Initiative to promote active volunteerism to those who have a passion to help seniors hop onto the digital bandwagon. Volunteers play an essential role in ensuring seniors keep up with the trainers during IT workshops and tutorials. Since the launch, over 500 adult and student volunteers had come forward annually to support the Silver Infocomm Initiative outreach efforts.

Building on the Friends of Silver Infocomm programme, SG:D Friends programme offers expanded opportunities for everyone, as well as public and private organisations, to reach out to all segments of the community, including mature adults and seniors, students, low-income families and people with disabilities. In addition to supporting digital readiness (“DR”) activities through volunteering, partners will also be able to take on a larger role in multiplying the DR outreach efforts.
